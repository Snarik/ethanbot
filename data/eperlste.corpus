why did the basic science lobbying effort fail while the translational lobbying efforts succeeded?

Gusella (MGH): the best disease models are genetically matched to patients, not phenotypically matched - critical difference. #NCL2016Boston
I can tell you for a fact that traditional life science VCs don't tolerate business model risk (anymore). Tech VCs more tolerant
why do billionaires need to be empowered? don't they just need to be educated (scientifically)?
First up is a keynote from Jim Gusella (MGH): "The genetic research cycle in human disease." #NCL2016Boston

angel/seed funding, but that's to be expected. At the institutional financing stage, VCs are only ones who can cut > $10M checks
After 50 meetings w/ life sciences VCs I can safely conclude that it's a waste of my precious fundraising time. Waiting to be proved wrong..

ethan@perlara
 But the worst one: I'll invest but I don't want to lead.
right here!
whoever told you that is wrong. Intros from VCs who pass are the worst kind of intro
Nothing drives me crazier about fundraising than VCs saying they want to "cheer from the sidelines." They all use that same damn phrase!
Bingo
When a VC passes but asks "How can I be helpful?" it's like a boy/girlfriend breaking up with you saying "I hope we can still be friends."

which startup's growth isn't painful?
 All women physicists should jointly win a Nobel Prize for co-discovering a mysterious invisibility field.
The less experienced a founder is at fundraising, the more they get stringed along by investors, especially institutionals, eg VC
If VCs offer to help or to be helpful, it's code for: I'm not going to invest but I don't want to say no and save you (founder) the trouble
So you get intro'd to a VC and he says: "Sorry about the delay, things have been busy, happy to schedule a call if helpful." Translation: 👎

I know I'm onto something! Biotech VCs aren't interested in funding Pharma 2.0 companies
but they're coming into this space precisely because biotech VCs have dropped the ball!
maybe the pitch evolved the way it did because traditional biotech investors wouldn't bite?
the research pie is getting bigger. I get mocking a press release, but all this hating is parochial
what sanctimony? it's calling pitching to crossover tech VCs!

Being a LSI fellow was an amazing scientific and pedagogical experience. And it prepared me to be a startup CEO
scientific failure, not reg failure
so when a program does succeed, they have to milk every last cent out of it
it's all about unit economics. Right now failure rates so high that most drug programs have to written off at a total loss
price controls don't affect our business. It's more likely (than caps) that competition/innovation will be long-term salves
I want to see more orphan drugs selling at lower prices. The only way to get there organically is by reducing R&D failure rate
we're not developing and selling approved drugs. We're a drug discovery company. Our partners develop (and price)
nobody publishes true R&D costs; discount/rebate schemes also super opaque. 30 years ago, a year of AZT was record breaking $30k
only way to dislodge us from this equilibrium is another drug pricing scandal/furor, or radically lowered R&D unit economics
objectively a lot. Comparatively, price trend is flat. I think $300k is as much a ceiling now as a floor
300k represents a peak of orphan prices, actually. Saw the same with Orkambi last year. Looks like $300K is the new ceiling
Takeaways: 1) Hope for 10% of DMD families 2) Slippery slope to repeal of Kefauver Harris? 3) Price is only $300k
when did they go to 3+2?

if you agree to be on a manel or attend a gender-imbalanced meeting, make a stink about it. Find allies, agitate
I'm advocating for diversity and gender parity
wasps are insects, too
Where are all the male allies in Biotech and Pharma? Time to come out of the woodwork, guys
absolutely!
are you tired of trying to get them to care? Can't speak for the old crusty set but men under 40 get it!
I do my agitating in biotech since that's my world. All conferences - academic and industry - need parity
refuse to sit on manels; make a stink at yammm's instead of sitting idly by; recommend more women for panels
do you think your males colleagues take diversity and gender parity at conferences seriously?
which is why most conferences are a waste of time! (That and all the manels..)
isn't this a goal of every conference, if we're really aspiring to a free and balanced market of ideas?
yah, what a concept. Canada has a gender split Cabinet. HRC promises same. So should conferences
we can walk and chew gum! Men in power need to stop being silent on the issue
this isn't CS or physics. The pool of bio PhDs is not skewed
Finally, a man has the balls to call out all the balls in conferences
Long past that time when men - especially in BioPharma - stand up for gender parity at conferences
#manel #yammm (yet another mostly make conference)
unfortunate it's unlikely men will back out. Hopefully they attend & speak out on the issue live at the conference
 Dear why are you sponsoring a meeting w/ such skewed speaker gender %?
amen! I've been to this meeting in past years and lost interest when I realized it was a #yammm #testiclefestival

8/ Every investor knows how to say "I want to invest." If they're saying nice things but not those exact words, they're stringing you along.
7/ Venture Capital's a misnomer. It's almost always Follow Capital, especially for companies that don't fit neatly into or subvert the mold.
6/ If you ask someone for investor intros and they don't oblige within 24 hours, it's not happening. Don't bother pinging them again. Next.
5/ If an investor questions your business model, back away. If they question your team, walk away. If they question your track record, run.
4/ Investors love to pass without saying the word no. If the email starts off "We love what you're doing!" stop reading, it's a no.
3/ It should only take two in-person meetings with a fund to get an offer. 1st meeting with lead partner, 2nd meeting with full partnership.
2/ Beware investors -- individuals or funds -- whose intellectual curiosity > domain expertise. They'll get your hopes up every single time.

yep. That's the consensus
applies also to undoing the damage of bad press releases of peer reviewed papers. I think more transparency is the solution
not livestreaming experiments!
real-time as in when the data are becoming clear
tell that to every grassroots social movement. You make of it what you will.
we also use the blog to review other papers, etc. and once we publish, we'll do blog summaries too
I guess I'm really arguing for prepreprints
and if we learn more or the conclusions change, what's wrong with pointing to the lineage of data/ideas?
of course! But we don't blog about data until we confident in it. I see blogs as prepreprints, if you will
that's what I'm trying to understand
blogging isn't necessarily for immature science. Just more bite-sized and incremental
what we have today's is either paywalled discovery or scicomm by press release. Has to be a better way..
I don't agree. Non-scientists need to be explained responsibly by scientists that discovery is one step forward, two steps back
I never said an unadulterated livestream of pipetting. Use discretion and blog about controlled "mini-stories"
 blogging has benefited my (very unconventional) career path a LOT.

Every scientist - academic or industry, trainee or citizen - should embrace Open Science!
love it! just came from a conference where I asked a lot of new PIs what they think about it, hence this poll
yes! I'm not asking people to attach a GoPro to their foreheads and beam every Western blot in real-time
aren't the people most likely to scoop the least likely to even know what a blog is?

is the learning curve that steep? blogging is just a preprint precursor
then do it!
I know, though it seems from my nothing little poll most new PIs would if they had the time. only 10% fear it hurts tenure chances
we're not livestreaming results! we exercise discretion. too many biopharma companies talk abt patients first, but it's just words
sure sounded like it!
(oh and psst, our careers don't depend anymore on us publishing)
you clearly don't appreciate Pharma's dim view of whole-animal phenotypic screens!
 mostly time, but would be happy for anyone in my lab to blog their results in real-time!
alas that's the majority answer
then you don't understand what a Public Benefit Corporation is. look it up before you make assumptions?
1) you could have a group/lab blog! 2) work in a more open field? 3) you gain outsized status/credibility?
 0) to protect my students 1) my area's full of thieves 2) i'm small fry in a pond w/ big fish o'wise, i'm in favor!
so that's why you think we do it?
3 hours behind you!
also ironic that taxpayer funded academic labs in this regard r more economically rational than an investor backed company
excuses excuses
not for whatever reason. it's about creating a culture of Open Science in an industry ill-reputed for doing the opposite

I agree. Interesting to see the reactions I'm getting. Men are like "no biggie;" women are like "hmmmm.."

it's no different than when a parent kvells about one child in front of their siblings. How does that make them feel?
PIs could say: "all my trainees are very talented; today I'm going to tell you about so and so's project"

 Kingsley group developed genetic resources for stickleback to study their fascinating evolution #TAGC16
You can only get away with saying "soft-mouthed predator" at a genetics conference. #TAGC16
Kingsley: sticklebacks are exemplary non-model org for studying evolution because they underwent repeated, independent radiations. #TAGC16
David Kingsley (@Stanford): Fishing for the secrets of stickleback and human evolution. #TAGC16
also possible that PRDM9 evolved as a defense against selfish genetic elements (eg transposons)
PRDM9-less vertebrates direct recombination to promoters; PRDM9-competent vertebrates direct recombination to TSS's. #TAGC16
 we're all related by a huge, unknown pedigree, can use to study evolution of recombination #TAGC16
PRDM9-mediated recombination is concentrated at transcription start sites across species. #TAGC16
PRDM9 is a rapidly evolving zinc finger protein that directs recombination at "hot" alleles > "cold" alleles. #TAGC16

Man, never catches a break. #TAGC16
I dunno. It's always said by a PI with earnest affection. But I wonder how all the other ppl in the lab feel..
A bit disappointed that didn't explain balancing selection with emoji. #TAGC16
pheromone-sensitive and pheromone-resistant isolates are found in the same geographic location --> balancing selection. #TAGC16
there are 61 regions in C. elegans genome that are highly divergent from the genome average, i.e., 10-100X more SNPs. #TAGC16
sensory receptors are some of the most rapidly evolving genes in the genome, rivaled only by immune receptors. #TAGC16
lol
When a PI describes work by a "very talented grad student/postdoc" does that imply that their other trainees are under-performers? #TAGC16
different wild isolates have different pheromone responsiveness. Crossing/mapping revealed QTL containing multiple GPCRs #TAGC16

Pandey: screened FUS fly against 300 deficiency lines, found 41 strong suppressors including muscleblind, a mRNA-binding protein. #TAGC16
Pandey: RNA-binding-incompetent FUS variants (mutated residues in the RNA binding domain) remains in the nucleus. #TAGC16
Pandey: fly model of FUS-mediated ALS involves expressing mutant FUS in the eye; these flies also have developmental defects. #TAGC16

livetweet talks! Oh, and come to the tweetup
looks like everyone in my peer group is moving on to kid #2, congrats!
eager to see what you've found
well, everyone is saying it at #TAGC16
it's hard to explain without invoking non-scientific factors, like publish or perish culture incentivizing hyper-reductionism
can't rewrite history. some seminal discoveries were made by (now) old white men
OH: "There's no better time to be a biologist." I agree (kinda) but really? Didn't people say that in 1953? In the mid-70s? In 2000? #TAGC16
Why haven't all the great molecular biology discoveries of 80s/90s been formalized into systems models? Blame science or scientists? #TAGC16
as opposed to TALENs and CRISPR? cc
opening session on Hox is 100% brotastic
I was only partly joking
all old white men, they can't be trusted
if you're a computational biologist, you have a lot of time on your hands bc you're not doing experiments!

you should pay your tutors for all that learning ;)
hmm, why do you think there's a divide even on the comp side? Data silos? Community silos?
then you're a NewCo lurker! ;)
wet lab. Dry lab is species-agnostic by definition #TAGC16
How many labs presenting at #TAGC16 use more than one model organism? More than two? More than 3?
sure, but do you invest?
.@jo_schacherer: sometimes a mutation is monogenic; sometimes that same mutation in another background is complex. Deal with it. #TAGC16
there's enough to go around. Besides, Indiebio is 90% synbio, not much drug discovery
we're hiring but not biochemists. Know any geneticists? :)

"undruggable" is a construct of target-based screening, no? If you embrace phenotypic, anything is possible, right?
great! Cell biologists are the slowest adopters
they also have to be protective of their time and expectations. Associate = sales call
 Patients are smarter than given credit for, and transparency fosters innovation
it's okay, it's been an emotional week for your people
well, and get what I'm saying. That's good enough for me
you can't truly assess the former without the latter
you can pitch that to the Discovery Channel!
Patients don't give a damn abt inside baseball, eg which coast VCs lavish w/ more $. They want transparency of scientific, business process.
it's simple: use discretion! Open Science doesn't mean 24/7 unexpurgated livestream
One simple thing BioPharma can do to really put patients first? Blog. Blog about R&D in real-time. Blog about budgets, pricing and costs.
that is correct, sir!
would versus are! Either way, it's (pure) capitalism bc people are pursuing self interest and in the process benefiting others
that's one distinction, yes. Bootstrapping/incremental funding tranches another. Biggest one to my mind is founder = CEO
I think they call it capitalism
it's a spinout, not a startup! Yuuuuge difference, starting with Series A
what if academia had its chance?
but longitudinal baseline measurements are dangerous! Dangerous!
social justice warrior, you
I'm an "insider" and I find the W vs E coast debate ponderous. (Thanks for feedback on the blog! Looking into ur question now..)
obsess over versus cares, there's a difference
maybe we need to be thinking more about telemedicine and the like? For rare diseases, everyone is by definition scattered
sure, but there's nothing non-obvious about that list as it's highly correlated with economic activity
exactly my point
only the commentariat obsesses over this silly coastal rivalry. Patients for whom Pharma ostensibly works don't care
thought it was just me!
is the expectation that these NewCos won't be VC backed, instead bootstrapping/grant/angel funded?
the kids making a fin with their left hand must be lefties! Have you noticed that before?
it's your advisor's responsibility to teach you (academic) negotiations 101. If that fails, it's on you to query older peers

it'll be 2-2, and I'm saying this as a GSW fan. It'll be a great series, don't you worry
go Dubs!
hope I made things clearer, not murkier!
I agree! My complaint is that a community arbitrarily decides cell type A is the best model to exclusion of all else
you can do metabolomics and biochemistry on cells, but fundamentally observations are cell-based
experiments involving cells vs purified molecules or animals
in other words
IOW cell biology (vs genetics or biochemistry) is the most unreproducible subfield of modern experiential biology
they control it in their own lab. Whether others follow suit is the problem. Not helped when Methods & Materials contain gaps
go Dubs!
This is not news but cell biology is artifact central. No one properly controls for cell type, culture media, passage number, etc. Oy...

 Postdoc positions are so abundant because they are so cheap. That's about to change.
and we all know who the middle finger of that hand is

does MIT have a preprint BSD champion? Quick, someone convince Sue Lindquist or Bob Langer
technically it's a BSD surge. Hey have you looked at aggregate submission data w/r/t institution?
well said
so do I! Why are so many of your colleagues not getting it then (despite the surge in bioRxiv submissions)?

 Hey, could you really not find even one woman to write about evolution? This is unacceptable in 2016.
if you only knew..
but how can you be trusted not to fail? You've never done it before!
 .@eperlste Yeah - it's ugly in pharma. Synbio is the opposite of this btw - most CEO/founders <40. Prob why pharma…
the kinds of founders I'm talking about are at YC or Indiebio; they never get seeded by firms like Atlas
Bruce said it himself: Atlas NewCos don't need formal CEOs bc they're all virtual companies anyway
veterans of Pharma senior management or C-suite are not noobs!! That's my entire argument
yes, they're more challenging (and interesting). And outcomes can be less binary (drug candidate worked or didn't)
I'm not asking VCs to dump $15M in a first-timer's lap. Start with a $2M bet. But even that's apparently too much
which is why I would advise first-timers away from single-asset plays and towards platforms instead
that's why the right seasoned advisors are so critical. And newbies should spend a year before launch learning
these can learned on the job or provided by seasoned advisors. That's why companies start with seed funding and grow (or not)
it doesn't take all those things to start a company. That's my point
what evidence supports that claim?
young founders are justifiably frustrated that establishment VCs dismiss them out of hand
how motivating!
 what data supports that claim in biotech when approx. ~ 0% of CEO's are under 40?
tech doesn't have this problem (it has others)
Thank god for

power law!
BSD lab sheds 1 PD so that 10 non-BSD labs can each pay a PD a living wage. The top 10% of labs can tighten the belt a notch

maybe that means labs are too big? Even if by just 1 person
but you're a socialist who knows how to run an efficient operation and be a good manager!

bias creates inefficiency. Biotech VCs also bias against unicorns by picking 1 vs 10. But they're more jaundiced by R&D failure..

not true. They need angels instead of VCs then
agreed later in the life of a company founders shouldn't overoptimize for dilution
younger founders want control of vision, not looking to be an employee
that's not how founders think, especially early in life of a company
shouldn't that be the norm?
I think it's a problem (for founders) that VCs want to take ownership stake early
ah you mean they're not taking enough of the company, yes
input, sure. Board seat, yes. But micromanaging, no!
founder-led companies don't need hand holding!
biotech VCs don't expect unicorns like tech. They assume "build to buy" best case
that's not a problem that's an opportunity!
 Medical researchers are addicted to elite journals. That's costing lives #ASAPbio By me

Too many tenured academics are making excuses about culture, their trainees, etc. Just freaking lead by example!

it really is that easy (on paper): coordinated effort by those in power

the cult of the PI is academic biology's perverse rugged individualism. Where's the communitarianism?
I see so many biologists saying "openness/sharing/preprints is not in our culture." People, you make the culture, not the other way around!
sure, but what about physics and math made them receptive to preprints? Is their culture fundamentally more open?
same applies to Twitter. Building filters is the easy part; building community is hard

Is there such a thing as corporate caloric restriction, i.e., bigco departments/divisions have to have the same output with half the budget?
Bigcos want to be like startups but I'm not sure you can separate the existential dread/resource limitation of a startup from its culture.
Learned a lot at future of biotech forum at yesterday. Bigcos desperately want startup culture and Millennial retention.
actually, startups see bigcos like Millennials see Boomers: "Our ideas are just as good as theirs but we have less access/$.'
Every large company looks at a startup and thinks "why can't we be more like them?" Every startup looks at a large company & says the same.

 in which a Twitter developer finally discovers Twitter
For the love of everything holy - I left Facebook for Twitter for a reason.
interactive alone is not really worth it
it's never about who's making the intro; it's whether the intro is warm or not
do you think I would have tweeted that if the answer was yes? ;)
bottom line: investors will always be attracted to success. Everything else is a sideshow
you clearly haven't been fundraising enough! Playing that game makes you jaded
interactions without investment? That's an oxymoron. Sounds like they're playing you for domain knowledge.
today's VCs are lazier and more PE-like than their forbears. They used to derisk with their own two hands
you need some experience on the team, obviously! Never said otherwise
no, but investors should not pass up on first timers with no track record. Having no track record is not the same as failure
some VCs are exceptional for sure, but most deliver middling returns as an asset class
yes there is, if only by virtue of the fact that the rich (exited CEOs/veteran teams) get richer
no it's not. VCs are as dime a dozen as founders
ill pass on going around this merry go-round for the 1000th time. I made my intentions clear when I moved to the Bay Area!
wow, that's deep
how many millennial founders, not talking about joining a team
It always cracks me up whenever a VC asks how they (he) can help. Um, give me money! It's really that simple. Or pass and get out the way.
it's not a controversial statement!
I don't think so
Last up artificial lab-grown meat. One of several companies in the hyper-salivating foodtech space.
One gaping hole in batch: therapeutics companies. It's not their fault. Unfortunately the old guard is shutting out millennials.
Surprising number of have already closed seed rounds. Will be interesting to see how much more they raise in the coming days/weeks.
Awesome to see near gender parity among company founders. Millennials are the saviors of capitalism.
seems like the minority (n=14)
I take VCs at their word when they say they won't touch millenial-led companies. Logic is: fund those who are already successful
.@indbio is a deserving middle finger to traditional biotech VCs who've abandoned early stage startups because they won't fund millennials.

 My story on an ugly incident of sexual misconduct in academic science & the broken system that failed to prevent it

Big Science's burden
hate for Big Science is hardly surprising in this day and age. Stop being mad and take back the conversation
I know! The Broad does so much good and has amazing scientists yet gets flak. But you have no one to blame but your leader.
academia has a #menotwe prob separate from PR hype, which btw had nothing to do with my original point. Hype is universal prob
the Broad was created for the common good (or so everyone thought..)
I should have said academic big science. Small labs are just caught in the undertow
academic artisanal labs are not the problem, clearly. I think we all agree there
I care!
what do the winners get?
Might assume it's the other way around but there's more ego, less team in academic science than in startup science. Or is it just the Broad?

how about every scientist on Twitter adopts a journalist on Twitter?
is Bernie projected to turn out more independents than the 08 Obama coalition? Seems he's doing as well as in polls..
 More jobs at Gimlet, people! Are you an editor? Maybe a science producer? A VP of Finance? We want you all!
it is because investors who want to wait need to be negatively reinforced otherwise they'll always sit back

then f*cking say it! Problem is also that founders don't have enough self-confidence

not true?
startup is based more on size more than age, IMO. (A startup older than 5 but still small is called a small business)

 For science PhD stdts & postdocs, networking is under-taught, under-developed, under-appreciated. Big training gap.
 talking to a biotech with a phase-3 candidate for a finance / strategy role, found via 3rd party recruiter
 Networks by far! We all trust referrals. The best jobs are ones that are created for you, not assigned.
Word to the wise for biomed trainees thinking about biotech startups: find out how you're connected to people already working at one.
 #Biotech and #startup friends - vote in survey. We need more data to better deploy scientific talent!
already kind of did that. Majority of millennial trainees are cool with startups
should have done that instead of job fair, oh well

when will this cycle be broken?
I've never made a drug, but somehow I was able to find amazing advisors who have. Why is that not good enough?
if making a drug is a requirement, then why are you surprised NewCo formation is flat?
why?
many don't know anything else; have been acculturated in lab life since late teens/early 20s
best recent example I know is Pat Brown at Impossible Foods
I'm not talking about 20-yr old founders. I'm talking about 30-35 year old founders
exactly my point: you're saying only people with previous experience are given the chance to found companies
Really the only thing you need to know about startup fundraising: 1 in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.
IOW, are biotech NewCos increasingly founded by teams that have previously founded other companies?
what's the distribution of founding team previous company experience for NewCos over time?

wait, what year is it again? It's like some parts of academia exist in some parallel Internetless dimension
you're even more likable in person!
it's almost as if their corporate charters give them the right to maximize profits
ideally, they're coupled and rise (and fall) together
why do you say that?
it's kind of ironic that the beneficiaries of American socialism also benefit from Wall St capitalism. Playing both sides...
consumer surplus?
PBCs are still for-profit! It's not a communist plot to subvert capitalism. It's actually the antidote to sick capitalism
the point is no company is forced to only maximize profits. There are alternatives besides feel-good talking points
it would have to be a coordinated effort
