Lack of mental health treatment is a major crisis. Less than 50% of adults with mental illness received the treatment they needed last year.

We need to change the electoral college.
Trump received 2.5 million fewer votes than Clinton, yet he'll soon be president. Clearly, in a democratic society, this shouldn't happen.
The function of prescription drugs should be to protect and improve human health, not make drug company CEOs rich.
You don’t appoint a cabinet of billionaires if you want to take on the establishment.
The business model of the pharmaceutical industry is fraud. They lie and collude to drive prices up.
I’ve been criticized for this point, so allow me to repeat it: Yes, health care is a right of all people.

People are not truly free when they are unable to feed their family. People are not truly free when they have no health care.

If you work 40 hours a week at the current federal minimum wage, you are making about $15,000 a year. That is undoubtedly a starvation wage.

A president of the United States should not have a racist at his side. Unacceptable.
Many people voted for Trump because they believed he would stand up to the establishment. The truth is he won't. But we will.

NEWS: Sanders Statement on Trump
Election Day should be a national holiday so that everyone has the time and opportunity to vote.
In a democracy the drug companies and the billionaire class should not be able to buy elections.
Enough with cowardly politicians protecting themselves by suppressing the vote. It’s time to ensure that voting remains a right for all.
 All across America, people seem to agree on the awesomeness of Burlingtonians. Here's what we can learn from them
In 2016 it is embarrassing that women earn 80% of what men make. I know every man will stand with the women in the fight for pay equity,
Democracy is not when cowardly governors go out of their way to make it difficult for people to vote.
You can refinance your home at 3%. Why in god's name are people paying 10% interest rates on your student debt?
To the drug companies I say: Stop ripping off the American people. And if you don't do it on your own, we will do it for you.
Americans are sick and tired of seeing drug prices soar when the 5 major drug companies made $50 billion in profits last year.
Nobody who works 40 hours a week should be living in poverty. We are going to raise the minim wage to a living wage.

5) The Native American people have been taken advantage of for too long. They have been lied to and exploited. That has got to stop.
4) It is simply unacceptable to build a project like this without the approval of the Native American residents who live there.
3) Oil transported through the pipeline would produce carbon emissions equivalent to 21 million cars or 30 coal plants.
2) The Missouri River provides drinking water for 10 states and 28 tribes. A leak could threaten access to clean water for millions.

ICE shouldn’t use immigrants to replace prisoners. We must eliminate costly and inhumane private prisons.
It is more than irresponsible for my Republican colleagues to risk the future of our planet in order to pander to fossil fuel lobbyists.
Climate change is happening and it is caused by humans. That is plainly not debatable at this point.
Considering the planetary crisis we face, it is completely inappropriate to continue giving billions in tax breaks to fossil fuel companies.
When scientists tell us that we must transition away from fossil fuels, the last thing we should do is drill for oil in the Arctic.

It is more than irresponsible for my Republican colleagues to risk the future of our planet in order to pander to fossil fuel lobbyists.
I fear very much that, in fact, government of the people, by the people and for the people is beginning to perish in America.
DHS should follow DOJ's lead and phase out for-profit immigration detention facilities. These private prisons cost more and are less humane.
We need real competition to lower drug prices, not corporations offering generic versions of their own drugs for whatever price they want.
At $300 generic EpiPens will still cost 3 times more than they did in 2007. This isn't a discount. It's a PR move.
We can no longer tolerate a criminal justice system that treats Wall Street executives as too big to jail.

While Americans are dying because they can't afford Mylan's egregious drug prices, the company’s CEO got a 671% raise to over $18 million.
It’s not a mystery why drug companies raise their prices to obscene levels. Just look at the multi-million dollar paychecks their CEOs get.

The New York Times agrees: The Stabenow-Roberts bill is deeply flawed and should not pass.
Your constitutional rights don’t depend on your race, gender, religion, sexuality or income. I can’t believe we still need to say that.
The struggle for our rights is not the struggle of a day, or a year. It is a struggle that must be fought by every generation.

 The Senate should not be in the business of hiding information from consumers. #GMO
92% of consumers think GMOs should be labeled. Congress should represent this enormous majority, not just wealthy corporations.
The Stabenow-Roberts GMO bill is confusing, misleading and unenforceable. It does nothing to make sure consumers know what they’re eating.
Companies all over the country are already labeling GMOs and, guess what, the sky didn't fall.
If 64 countries already require labeling of GMOs, is it really such a radical idea?
Sen. Sanders speaking about the Senate GMO labeling bill now. Watch here:
Agribusiness spent $52 million in campaign contributions this election cycle. It’s not a mystery why Congress won’t support GMO labeling.
Real family values are paid sick time, paid family leave and guaranteed vacation time so parents can spend leisure time with their children.
Mars, the Grocery Manufacturers Association and North American Meat Institute support the anti-GMO bill. Consumers aren't the priority here.
People have a right to know what's in the food they eat and feed their children. Congress must protect that right.
This is intentionally confusing to consumers, and the information may be entirely inaccessible for many consumers.
The trade agreements pushed by corporate America are great if you are CEO of a major corporation, but are a disaster for American workers.
64 other countries around the world require the mandatory labeling of GMO foods. The current Senate bill would not.
The views of the billionaire class are profoundly out of step with working Americans, which goes a long way to explain Congress' agenda.
Happy 4th of July!
Whose views should we trust on trade legislation? Corporate America or organizations that represent working families and the environment?
It's interesting that Republicans who tell us how terrible the government is, now want to overturn GMO labeling laws passed in 4 states.
Understanding the magnitude of the climate crisis means realizing that good environmental policy is also good economic policy.

The anti-GMO bill is confusing and toothless. It will do nothing to help with food transparency and harm the already work done by states.
Big Ag spent hundreds of millions on lobbying and campaign contributions to stop GMO labeling laws. We can’t let them get away with it.
Food companies believe they have a right to unlimited profits, but they don't think people have a right to know what's in the food they eat.
The anti-GMO bill in the Senate is confusing, misleading and unenforceable. We must have higher standards than that for federal legislation.
The Stabenow-Roberts anti-GMO bill contains huge loopholes in the labeling requirement. There’s not even a penalty for violating it.
The poor will see politics as irrelevant and won't join the political process as long as both parties continue to ignore their problems.
Monsanto's goal is to deny states the right to label GMOs. If we don't stop them, they may just succeed. Watch:
Change happens in this country when people come together to say the status quo is unacceptable. I believe we are in such a moment right now.
I am proud that Vermont is first state to mandate GMO labeling. What I’m not proud of is the Senate bill trying to destroy this progress.
 Bernie blasts Puerto Rico bill and Wall Street vulture funds in powerful Senate speech
 First look: What does think of a federal GMO compromise that would affect Vermont's law? WATCH:
Sen. Roberts' GMO bill imposes no penalties whatsoever for violating the labeling requirement, making the law essentially meaningless.
The GMO legislation in Congress would create a confusing, misleading and unenforceable national standard for labeling GMOs. It cannot pass.

Vermont has shown what happens when democracy works. The people speak, state government responds and important legislation gets passed.

It's long past time we opened the military to openly transgender people. Glad to see this step toward equality.
My entire political career has been dedicated to the conviction that Americans are entitled to live lives of decency and dignity.
Proud will take part in Second Chance Pell. Rehabilitation, not more incarceration, will help inmates get back on their feet.
It really is frightening when you have a party that controls both the House and Senate that says, "You know what? We reject science."
We can live in a country where every person who dreams of becoming a citizen has a rational path forward, not just a dark corner to hide in.
 Sanders steps up battle against GMO bill
We need fair trade not “free trade.” Americans should not have to compete against workers in low-wage countries who earn pennies an hour.
I'll do everything I can to defeat this pathetic GMO labeling bill. It is not only misleading, it's toothless. The fight is not over.
The overwhelming majority of Americans agree: GMOs should be labeled.
We have an economic model developed by the economic elite to benefit the economic elite. We need real change.
Another reason why this bill must be defeated.
Decisions made regarding the future of Puerto Rico must be made by the people of Puerto Rico. America must not become a colonial master.
It would be a colossal tragedy if the next generation had a lower standard of living than their parents, but that is where we're headed.
Morally, should we allow Wall Street to make huge profits, while nutrition programs for Puerto Rican kids are cut?
The time has come to stop treating Puerto Rico like a colony and start treating the people of Puerto Rico as American citizens.
Billionaires can't receive a 100% return on investments while Puerto Rican children go hungry. Puerto Rico can't be hijacked by Wall Street.
At a time when the people of Puerto Rico are suffering, PROMESA would make a terrible situation even worse.
It's not a radical idea to tell people what's in the food they're eating. 64 countries label GMOs. Why can't the US?
Incredibly, the wealthiest 62 people on the planet now own as much wealth as the bottom half of the world's population - 3.7 billion people.
People have a right to know what’s in their food. Vermont has taken the lead on GMO labeling—now we need it everywhere.
This bill requires Puerto Ricans to pay for the undemocratic control board at an unbelievable sum of $370 million. That's absurd.
From a moral perspective, should we pass legislation that rewards billionaires, while allowing schools to be closed and pensions to be cut?
The Republicans' solution to the Puerto Rico debt crisis is colonialism at its worst.

Glad to see the Court agrees women should have access to their full array of health care options.
The skyrocketing cost of college today is not just a loss for many bright young people and their families; it is a loss to our country.
Let's face it: until we put patients over profits, our health care system will not work for ordinary Americans.
The test of a great nation is not how many wars we can engage in, but how we can use our strength to resolve conflicts in a peaceful way.

The value of the minimum wage is 25% lower than it was in 1968. It’s not a radical idea to try to keep up with costs of living.

Freedom of speech, in my view, does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government.

We can't continue to employ inhumane tactics involving deporting thousands of families to address a crisis that requires a humane solution.
I urge to immediately cease the deportation raids and not deport families back to countries where a death sentence awaits.
NEWS: Sanders calls on Obama to end deportation raids, extend Temporary Protected Status to vulnerable families
The time is long overdue for this great country to join to the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care as a right to all.
Our corrupt system allowed Wall Street during the 1990s to spend $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions to get deregulated.
American becomes a greater nation when we stand together as one people and loudly and clearly say no to all forms of racism and bigotry.
The witch-hunt against Planned Parenthood, which provides critical health care to 3 million women, must end.
The Republican budget is not only bad legislation (and it is), it is also a waste of time.
The last thing we need is a budget reconciliation bill that throws 17 million Americans off health insurance and defunds Planned Parenthood.
75% of insured people struggling to pay medical bills make sacrifices like not buying food and household items:
We have got to demilitarize our local police departments so they do not look like invading armies.
When we talk about our responsibility as human beings, there is nothing more important than leaving this planet healthy and habitable.
Right now, our energy policy is rigged to boost the profits of big oil companies like Exxon and BP at the expense of average Americans.
One of the reasons that the rich are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer is that we have a corrupt campaign finance system.
We've got to discourage reckless gambling on Wall Street and use the revenue from a speculation tax to make public colleges tuition free.
Last week, the North Pole was warmer than Western Texas, Southern California, and parts of the Sahara.
Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing our economy's near collapse. Big bankers must not be too big to jail.
We have got to discourage reckless gambling on Wall Street and encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy.
In my view, it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $5 fee each time they go to the ATM.
Greed, fraud, dishonesty and arrogance, these are the words that best describe the reality of Wall Street today.
We cannot tolerate an economy and a political system that's been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest at everyone else's expense.
The decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman, her family and physician to make, not the government. #StoptheSham
A vast majority of Americans, including responsible gun owners, agree with the common sense reforms announced today.
Republicans are clearly more loyal to gun lobbyists than our children. I support executive actions to make our communities safer.
Our goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of billionaires.
Wall Street cannot be an island unto itself, gambling trillions of dollars. If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist.

This is the richest country in the history of the world. Millions of our people should not be living in poverty.
Instead of giving huge tax breaks to the wealthy, we should pay attention to the needs of seniors trying to survive on just $12,000 a year.
We judge a country not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it produces, but by how it treats the most vulnerable people.
How is it that a kid who smokes marijuana gets a police record, but the CEO of a company that ruins people’s lives has no criminal record.
We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. We should be investing in jobs and education, not more jail and incarceration.
What Republicans are saying, very loudly and clearly, is that no woman in this country, has the right to control her own body. I disagree.
The debate is over. Climate change is real, and it’s caused by human activity.
What we have to do is not let Donald Trump and these other people divide us up.
"The most serious of the evils that afflict the world these days are youth unemployment & the loneliness of the old"
The benchmark of full time work in America should be simple and concrete – that no full-time worker should live in poverty.
What do the Koch brothers want? Let me tell you. They don’t just want to cut Social Security, they want to eliminate Social Security.
Today, one family, the Walton family of Walmart, owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans!
Over half of American workers have less than $10,000 in savings and have no idea how they will be able to retire with any shred of dignity.
We have a system that treats too many citizens who have not committed crimes like criminals. That's a reality that must change.
Americans should not have to live in fear that they will go bankrupt if they get sick.
We need a movement which once and for all will end institutional racism in our country and reform a very broken criminal justice system.
It is grossly unfair that there are millionaires in this country who end up paying an effective tax rate lower than a middle-class worker.
It's not a radical concept that maybe the United States government should represent working families rather than a handful of billionaires.
People should not have to go without the medication they need just because politicians aren’t willing to challenge the drug lobby.
It is not a radical idea to say if a person works 40 hours a week that person should not live in poverty.
Happy New Year!
Today in America over 20% of our children are living in poverty — the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country.
The billionaire class cannot have it all. Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the one percent.
We cannot jail our way out of health problems like drug addiction or social and economic problems like poverty.
When Republicans talk about family values, they're talking about defunding Planned Parenthood.
Access to health care is a human right, and that includes access to safe and affordable prescription drugs.

I happen to believe that in a democratic, civilized society, all people should be entitled to health care as a right
Unlike Trump, who wants to give huge tax breaks to his fellow billionaires, we need to ask the wealthiest people to pay their fair share.
At a time of massive income and wealth inequality billionaires like Donald Trump should pay their fair share of taxes.
To say to some smart, young person: you're not going to be able to go to college because your family lacks the funds. That is pretty dumb.
11 million people cannot continue living in the shadows. We need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.
Republicans must start worrying about the planet they will leave their kids, not the campaign contributions they get from the Koch brothers.
It makes no sense that every year we lose $100 billion in tax revenue because profitable corporations stash their profits in tax havens.
Loudly and clearly, we must tell Republicans. No. We will not cut Social Security benefits for the elderly and disabled veterans.
I have a message for Donald Trump: No, we’re not going to hate Latinos, we’re not going to hate Muslims, we are going to stand together.
Many young people are leaving school deeply in debt for what? For the crime of trying to get an education and make it to the middle class.
We need major reforms in a very broken criminal justice system. We must stop the killing of unarmed African-Americans by the police.
We need to invest $1 trillion to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create up to 13 million decent-paying jobs.
Our foreign policy has failed the American people and led to wars like the war in Iraq which we should never have gotten into.
We are living in a rigged economy where corporate profits soar while millions of our children live in poverty.
It’s time to make banking work for the productive economy and for all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy speculators.
Republicans win elections when people don’t vote, when they turn off from politics. Progressives win when people know what’s going on.
Donald Trump wants to give billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top three tenths of 1 percent. That's not the America we need.
Nobody can recall a Christmas Eve where the temperature was 65 degrees. Why is it that we're not effectively addressing climate change?
The way we improve lives is by passing legislation which creates millions of decent paying jobs, not by having us hate Mexicans or Muslims.
We need a constitutional amendment that will overturn Citizens United and restore free and fair elections.
We need policies that bring us together, take on the greed of Wall St. and create an economy that works for all of us, rather than a few.
Donald Trump does not want to raise the minimum wage. In fact, he has said that he thinks wages in America are too high.
This nation and its government belong to all of the people, and not solely to a handful of billionaires, their super PACs and lobbyists.
Elections should be influenced by grassroots movements not a billionaire’s checkbook.
We have seen far too many people, often African Americans, who are unarmed, shot and killed by police officers.
 Bernie Sanders: If Sandra Bland were white, her death “would not have happened”

Nearly two-thirds of the electorate didn't vote in 2014. It's clear we need radical change to bring more people into the political system.
The Koch brothers intend to spend $750 million on this election. That's more than either the Democratic or Republican Party will spend.
Over the last 30 years there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent.
There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.
You have families out there paying 6, 8, 10 percent on student debt but you can refinance your homes at 3 percent. What sense is that?
We have a major health care crisis. 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions more can't afford to go to the doctor.
Why is it that the United States today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.
We must bring people together to take on the powerful who've hurt the middle class. Trump is trying to play on fears and divide us up.
Merry Christmas from the Sanders family!

Understand that Donald Trump thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea. He thinks low wages are a good idea.
Martin Luther King Jr. was right when he said: “This country has socialism for the rich, and rugged individualism for the poor."
True freedom does not occur without economic security. In other words, people are not truly free when they are unable to feed their family.
In the United States today, we have more income and wealth inequality than at any time since 1928. Anyone think that makes sense?
The minimum wage was originally described as “socialist.” Today it is seen as the foundation of the middle class.
The great middle class of America, once the envy of the entire world, has been disappearing. We must address this economic and moral issue.
Congress must pass legislation that make our rigged political and economic systems work for the vast majority of Americans not just the 1%.
The truth is we can't afford another spending package that expands the billionaire class's power and wealth at the expense of everyone else.
